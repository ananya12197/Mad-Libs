# Mad Libs Word Game

This fun little game lets you enter words that get inserted into a silly story.  
It was my first attempt at combining user input with dynamic text display using JavaScript.

### What you can do:
- Type a noun and a verb
- Click a button to generate a creative sentence!

### Takeaways:
I explored DOM manipulation and basic JavaScript functions while keeping the app playful.

I hope to add more word types and stories soon!
